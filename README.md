# Offical repository of the 02 imageset, start by me, (soarn)[https://github.com/soarn].

There's really no real code bits here, sure there's a website, but it does absolutely nothing, besides tile an image of 02 across your screen.

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="android-chrome-512x512.png" /></div>

If you want to make an actual website, feel free to PR, I only absolutely no one will though.

## If you want to add images to the imageset, make an issue, same with removing images.
